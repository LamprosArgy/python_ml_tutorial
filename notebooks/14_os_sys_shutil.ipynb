    "Up till now we've seen how to use python to solve simple math problems, store data in lists etc. But what if we wanted to make something more practical? Something that would help us crate scripts that automate some mundane tasks, such as copying, moving, renaming or deleting files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of file organization in operating systems are **paths**. Paths are strings that tell us where a certain file or folder can be found inside a the OS's directory structure. These files are typically organized in a hierarchical tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in **Windows** systems, in the root of a boot partition one can find the following folders:\n",
    "- `\\Program Files`: Is where the programs are installed\n",
    "- `\\ProgramData`: Contains program data that are expected to be accessed by computer programs regardless of the user account in the context of which they run.\n",
    "- `\\Users`: Is the user profile folder containing onw subfolder for each user.\n",
    "- `\\Windows`: Windows is installed in this folder.\n",
    "- `\\System`: Is where the DLLs, that implement the core features of Windows are stored.  \n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A path in a windows like system looks like:\n",
    "<pre>C:\\Users\\Thanos\\Projects\\Python\\</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that my user name is *`Thanos`* and that I have a folder called *`Python`* in another folder called *`Projects`* in my user directory. The *`C:`* part in the beginning means that my root directory is the partition *`C`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **UNIX** based systems, have their own directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/bin`: Contains the binaries for certain fundamental utilities.\n",
    "- `/boot`: Contains all the files needed for booting.\n",
    "- `/home`: Contains the a subfolder for each user (similar to window's *`\\Users`* folder).\n",
    "- `/lib`: Contains essencial libraries needed for the programs in *`/bin`*.  \n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix type paths use regular slashes (`/`) to separate directories.  \n",
    "Ths equivalent path in Unix would be:\n",
    "<pre>/home/thanos/projects/python/</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first slash in the beginning indicates the root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paths are used extensively in computer science to represent the directory/file relationships common in modern operating systems, and are essential in the construction of Uniform Resource Locators (**URL**s). Resources can be represented by either **absolute** or **relative** paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **absolute** or full path points to the same location in a file system, regardless of the current working directory. To do that, it must include start from root directory.\n",
    "- A **relative** path starts from some given working directory, avoiding the need to provide the full absolute path. A relative path **never** starts with a slash.\n",
