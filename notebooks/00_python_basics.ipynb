    "What is python exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.   \n",
    "-- Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that mean? Let's start from the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **programming language**. This means python is a language with which we can communicate to our computer and tell it what to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dynamic** programming language, is a programming language that executes it's commands at runtime. On the other hand *static* programming languages require a procedure that is called *compilation*. This procedure first translates the human-readable commands into machine-language instructions. An **interpreted** language doesn't require a *compiler* to run, but an *interpreter*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General-purpose** programming languages, are those that are used in a wide variety of application domains. On the contrary there are *domain-specific* programming languages that are used in a single domain. Some examples of the latter are *HTML* (markup language for web applications), *MATLAB* (matrix representation and visualization), *SQL* (relational database queries) and *UNIX shell scripts* (data organization in unix-based systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **high-level** programming language has a strong abstraction from the details of the computer. These languages are much easier to work with, because they automate many areas such as memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a really easy and powerful programming language and it has a simple and very straightforward syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two python versions running in parallel, **python 2.7** and **python 3.x**. While python 3 came out in 2008, it saw a slow adoption from the community. We will be using python 3 for the remainder of this tutorial, but the code will be **fully compatible** with python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are lines that are ignored from the computer and are meant only for humans to be read."
